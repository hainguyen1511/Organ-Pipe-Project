\chapter{Action Plan}

In this Chapter, we discuss different approaches for successfully improving the
organ pipe tuning process.
We discuss the project goals and objectives, potential solutions, and the
expected outcomes of the project.
Subsequently, we present the data available, some challenges and concerns that
we encountered.
Proposed methodologies are discussed and briefly explained.
Finally, we present the project timeline and the expected deliverables.

\section{Project Goals and Objectives}

The main goal of this project concerns the improvement of the organ pipe tuning
process.
As the organ pipe design is a complex process, and usually is not a reversible
process, it is important to ensure that the design of the pipes is done
correctly; this presents a key constraint for the tuning process.
The parameters that are involved are diverse, and despite being computable or
measurable, the access to this information does not simplify the tuning process.

A particular subgoal of this project is to improve the Ising
formula~\autocite{1971Ising-1}, which reads
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ising}
    \mathsf{I}
    =
    \frac{v}{\omega}\sqrt{\frac{d}{h^3}}
    =
    \frac{1}{\omega}\sqrt{\frac{2 P d}{\rho h^3}},
\end{equation}
where \(\mathsf{I}\) is the Ising number, \(\omega\) is the (target) frequency
of the pipe, \(v\) is the jet initial velocity, \(d\) is the jet initial
thickness, \(h\) is the cut-up height (or the length of the mouth), \(P\) is the
blowing pressure, and \(\rho\) is the density of the air.
From \autocite{1971Ising-1, 2025Lilj-1}, it is suggested that the Ising number
should be constant, preferably close to \( \mathsf{I} \approx 2\).

We would like to include the flow rate in the Ising formula~\ref{eq:ising}, so
this methodology can be used to dimension the pipes in a reliable way, before
the voicing stage.

\subsection{Key questions}

The following questions are key to the project, and we aim to address them to
our best ability:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can the Ising formula~\ref{eq:ising} be improved, refined, or
        corrected, in order to match measured data?
    \item Can the flow rate be included in the Ising formula~\ref{eq:ising}?
    \item Can we obtain a model reliable enough, that can be used to dimension the
        pipes before the voicing stage?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methodology}

We intend to use a combination of semianalitical methods, numerical methods,
machine learning techniques, and data analysis techniques to address the
questions presented in the previous section.

\subsection{Semianalytical methods}

As described in \autocite{2004RosFle-1}, the physics of the organ pipes relies
on the wave equation.
Exact solutions for the time-harmonic, longitudinal, wave equation can be
derived using the method of separation of variables.
\todo{Add more details about the semianalytical methods}

\subsection{Numerical methods: Finite Element Method}

The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a numerical method for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) and integral equations.
As the govening equations of the organ pipe are PDEs, we can use FEM to solve
them.
\todo{Add more details about the numerical methods}

\subsection{Machine learning techniques}

Modern machine learning techniques can be used to model the data, and to
predict the Ising number.
We use a simple neural network to model the data, and to predict the Ising
number.
\todo{Add more details about the machine learning techniques}
The final layer consists of a split layer, where one components relative to the
Ising number uses a Softplus activation function \todo{Ref needed}, and the
partials ratios are given by sigmoid activation functions \todo{Ref needed}.

\subsection{Generalized Additive Models}
