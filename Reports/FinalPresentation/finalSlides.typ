= Introduction

== On the art of organ voicing

+ Pipe organs have been around for hundreds of years, and making them sound just right is a special job called intonation, or _voicing_.
+ The way a pipe looks and is built -- like its size, shape, and material-- can change how it sounds.
+ These details are decided first, and then the pipes are fine-tuned before being added to the organ.

== Main goals

#columns(2)[
  #psu-block(title: "Ising Number as a predictor", fill-color: psu-purple)[
    - Ideally, we would like to use *the Ising number* to predict the intonation of a pipe.
    - Using a data-driven approach, we aim to correct the formulation of the Ising number, hopefully to integrate the flow of the wind jet in the pipe and improve the prediction of the intonation.

    - In general, it is desirable to have an understanding of *the distribution of the (intensity of the) partials of a pipe*.
    - Being able to model and predict the distribution of the partials of a pipe is a key aspect of voicing.

    It often has a monotone decay.

== The Ising number

#columns(2)[
  Define the *Ising number* of a pipe as follows:
  $
  sans(I) = frac(v,omega) sqrt(frac(d,h^3))
  = frac(1,omega) sqrt(frac(2 P d,rho h^3)).
  $
  Here:
  - $v$ is the velocity of the wind jet,
  - $omega$ is the frequency of the fundamental,
  - $d$ is the initial jet diameter,
  - $h$ is the cut-up height of the pipe,
  - $P$ is the pressure of the wind jet, and
  - $rho$ is the density of the air.

= Semi-analytical methods

We introduce some formula-based approaches to modify the Ising number to account for the flow of the wind jet in the pipe.

== Naive approach

A natural heuristic is the following: provided no airflow, there should be no need to modify the Ising number; in case of airflow, we expect to increase the Ising number, as the pipe is expected to _overblow_ at some point.

#psu-block(title: "Naive modified Ising number")[
  Let $sans(S)$ be the airflow of the wind jet on the toe-hole of the pipe.
  We propose a first *naive modified Ising number* as follows:
  $
  sans(I)_sans("naive") = sans(I) ( 1 + frac(1,2) sans(S) ).
  $
]

This approach is simple, but *breaks the dimensional analysis*, as it forces the factor $frac(1,2)$ to have dimensions of the reciprocal of the airflow.

#pagebreak()

== Flow-informed Ising number

A more sophisticated approach is to use the assumption that, on low velocities, the airflow is non-compressible.
We can use conservation of the airflow to modify the Ising number as follows: given two transversal areas $A_1$ and $A_2$ of the pipe system, and two velocities $v_1$ and $v_2$ of the wind jet, we have:
$
v_1 A_1 = v_2 A_2.
$

Thus, by assuming _the velocity from the system is known_, we can modify the Ising number as follows:
#psu-block(title: "Flow-informed modified Ising number")[
  Let $ v_serif("toe") = frac(A_serif("system"), A_serif("toe")) v_serif("system") $ be the velocity of the wind jet at the toe-hole of the pipe;
  then the *flow-informed Ising number* is defined as:
  $
  sans(I)_sans("flow-informed") = frac(v_serif("system") A_serif("system"),omega A_serif("system") ) sqrt(frac(d,h^3))
  = frac(A_serif("system"),omega A_serif("toe") ) sqrt(frac(2 P d,rho h^3)).
  $

  == Formatting the data

  We decided to use standar `csv` files to store the data, as they are easy to read and write with packages like #link("https://pandas.pydata.org/", "Pandas") or #link("https://www.pola.rs/", "Polars").
  We suggest to use the following labels for the columns in the data files:
  - `isBourdon`: a boolean (represented with an integer 0 or 1) indicating whether the pipe is a bourdon pipe (1) or not (0).
  - `flueDepth`: the depth of the flue of the pipe, in meters.
  - `frequency`: the frequency of the fundamental of the pipe, in Hertz.
  - `cutUpHeight`: the height of the cut-up of the pipe, in meters.
  - `diameterToe`: the diameter of the toe-hole of the pipe, in meters.
  - `acousticIntensity`: the acoustic intensity of the pipe, in decibels.
  - `partial1`, `partial2`, ..., `partial8`: the partials of the pipe, adimensional values.

  Despite the Ising number is adimensional, it is *unit-dependent*.
  Make sure to use the same units for all the data in the dataset:
  the range of "intonation" values may vary with different units.
]

=== How to enhance the model

It will be convenient to:
- Use a larger dataset, with more observations and *variability* in the parameters.
- Concatenate _new_ observations to the previous ones, to improve the model.

#pagebreak()

= Final remarks

== Potential further work

- Purely physical approach to the computation of the intensity: we want to model the partials without creating a pipe. Using FEM or CFD methods to compute the intensity of the partials.
- Explore flow-informed Ising number and cross-validate with the data: there are new measurements related to the opening of the channels and pallets.
