# Data Science Practicum: Tuesday, April 1, 2025

## Consulting process

- **Ask**: aim to fully understand the problem
- **Abstract**: formulate an abstraction
- **Translate**: translate into mathematical terms
- **Approval**: Make adjustments based on feedback; obtain client approval
- **Model**: Use the model to analyze the data
- **Communicate**: communicate results
- **Iterate**: repeat the above steps as needed...

## On asking

Goals:
- *Gather* information
- **Don't** leave unanswered questions

### Errors of the third kind

Example: Determine a distribution of the particle size in connection to
corriosion studies.

- Data presents a pattern:
    - Incremental in size
    - No repeated values
    - Small gaps, increasing in size eventually

Observation

- Data is, for example, a measurement of proportions (sedimentation).

### Identify

- Identify the type of investigation.
    - Designed experiment
        - Consider the manipulation done by investigator.
        - Selection of subjects
        - Assess causality
        - Requires to be possible and *feasible* (e.g., ethical)
    - Sample survey
        - Target population is specified
        - Sample is drawn at *random*
        - Collects characteristics of the population
        - Inference is made about the population
    - Observational study
        - No random sampling, no randomization
        - All observational data is assembled and used
        - Model can be used to illustrate and predict behavior
- Stage of investigation (7 stages)
    - Problem formulation (planning)
    - Data collection (planning)
    - Data curation (planning)
    - Data exploration (analysis)
    - Modeling and inference (analysis)
    - Result comparison (analysis)
    - Interpretation and communication (analysis)

#### What to assess?

We have to ask questions that help us on the *planning* stage of the investigation.
- **Layout** the goals of study
- **Identify** the data to be collected
- **Suggest** data collection strategies
- **Establish** suitable data analysis methods

Similar, we can ask questions that help us on the *analysis* stage of the investigation.
- **What** data was collected? **How** was it collected?
- **Determine** if data is useful
- **Assess** limitations of study
- **Identify** problematic corrections into the data

1. Observational study
    - Understand how the data was collected
    - Identify, understand confounding variables
    - Assess biases in data collection protocol
2. Designed experiment (TODO)
3. Sample survey (TODO)

#### On the client's field of study

- **Understand** the field of study
- **Communicate** with the client
- **Identify** source of random error
