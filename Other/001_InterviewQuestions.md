# Interview questions

1. What parameters are involved in the tuning of a pipe organ?
    - What are some parameters that are *not* being considered for this study/project?
    - What are, in *your experience*, the most important parameters? *Biased question*
2. How is the intonation process done?
    - How is the data you obained from the intonation process used?
2. What type of instruments are being used to measure the parameters?
    - What are the limitations of these instruments?
        - Are they any (physical, technical, etc.) *limitations*?
        - Is there any *manipulation* of the data?
    - Check concordance of what is being **measured** and **what is being used** in the model.
3. Can you describe, in a general way, the process of the *design* of a pipe organ?
    - What are the steps involved in the design of a pipe organ?
    - What is the step *we should be concerned about* (besides the intonation problem)?
4. How does a voicing bench work?
    - What are the standards for different *styles of instruments*?
    - How is the architecture of the location taken into account?
    - Idem for the *taste of the recipient*?
5. Inquire about the units of the measurements.
    - Compare and anontate with this [page](https://www.mmdigest.com/Tech/isint.html). 
    - (Hai) How to compute the acoustic intensity?
    - (Hai) Is there a related article or paper which describes the process of measuring the acoustic intensity?
    - (Hai) What is the relationship of the intensity and the measured parameters?
    - (Hai) What is the spectrum present in the data?
6. (Meghana) Why the data is so sparse?
    - (Meghana) What is the process of collecting the data?
    - (Meghana) Error measurement?
    - (Meghana) Potential pitfalls?
7. Licensing
    - What is the status of the data?
    - Can the data be made public? Under what license?
    - Can any code/software be made public? Under what license?

## What we should get out from the interview

1. Clarify parameters/data/labels
    - Acoustic intensity
    - Spectrum
    - Mini/Maxi?
    - *Relationship* between the parameters
2. Expectation of the project, and from the client.
